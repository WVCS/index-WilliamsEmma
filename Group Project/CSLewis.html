    <div class="text">
    <p> Clive Staples Lewis, more commonly known as C. S. Lewis, was born on November 29, 1898 and died on November 22, 1963. He was a British writer and Anglican lay theologian. He is best known as the author of <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, but he is also noted for his other works of fiction, such as <i>The Screwtape Letters</i> and <i>The Space Trilogy</i>, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, including <i>Mere Christianity</i>, <i>Miracles</i>, and <i>The Problem of Pain</i>. In total, Lewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations.

In 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on November 22, 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.</i></p>
