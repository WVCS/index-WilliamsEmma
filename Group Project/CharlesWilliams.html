  <h1> Charles Williams </h1>
    <div class="text">
    <p> Charles Walter Stansby Williams was a British poet, novelist, playwright, theologian, literary critic. He was born in Spetember 20, 2996 and died on May 15, 1945. He wrote 9 fiction books and stories, 18 plays, 7 volumes of poetry, 6 theological books, 10 works of literary criticism, 8 biographies, and 9 other works.
<br>
      <br>
In 1917 Williams married his first sweetheart, Florence Conway, following a long courtship during which he presented her with a sonnet sequence that would later become his first published book of poetry, <i>The Silver Stair</i>. Their son Michael was born in 1922. Williams was an unswerving and devoted member of the Church of England, reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a "doubting Thomas" in any apostolic body. <br>
      Williams is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford. His headstone bears the word "poet" followed by the words "Under the Mercy", a phrase often used by Williams himself.
