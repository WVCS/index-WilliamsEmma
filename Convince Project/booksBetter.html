    <h2> Some say that the movie is always better than the book because words on a paper are much more boring than a colorful movie, but I disagree. </h2>
    
  <h1> Why Books are Better than Movies </h1>
   <div id = "list">
    <ol>
      <li> Movies have a time limit and can't be too short or too long, while books can be any length </li>
      <img src="png-clipart-clock-clock-cartoon-thumbnail-removebg-preview.png" height = 100>
        <li> Books encourage creativity, as you picture the book scenes and characters for yourself. Everyone pictures it differently! </li>
      <img src = "ThoughtScene.png" height = 100>
        
      <li> Books help you increase your reading skills and broaden your vocabulary, while movies don't have any comparable benefits. And even if you don't care, your parents are much more likely to let you read for hours than watch movies for hours. </li>

    <h2> Make your own opinion in three easy steps! </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Find a book that you know there is a movie for and read it! </li>
      <li> Then, watch the movie </li>
      <li> Decide which you like better and submit your opinion on this google form! </li>
